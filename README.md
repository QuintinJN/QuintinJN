Hi I'm Quitin Nel

I'm currently a 3rd year student studying BSc Information Technology.
Throughout my education, I have demonstrated high levels of motivation, work ethic and teamwork to achieve my grades. I enjoy coding and learning about new technologies and seeing how the world changes around it.
